# Context

Web development is what made me start and love computer science, that's why creating my own website was inevitable. It was the opportunity for me to realize what I knew how to do best after a few years when I knew only how to write a little HTML/CSS.

This website aims to offer a clean showcase of the professional that I am by presenting both my background but also my main projects.
