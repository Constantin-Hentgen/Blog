# Linux Configuration and Tool Setup

This repository contains my personal Linux configuration files for tmux, nvim, i3, as well as scripts to automate the installation of these configurations and all my preferred tools and software on a fresh Fedora Linux system.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- A fresh installation of Fedora Linux with i3wm.
  - You can download the ISO from [Fedora i3 Spin](https://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/39/Spins/x86_64/iso/Fedora-i3-Live-x86_64-39-1.5.iso) or visit the [Fedora i3 Spin page](https://fedoraproject.org/spins/i3/).
- Set the keyboard layout to French BÃ‰PO AFNOR using the following command:

```bash
setxkbmap -layout fr -variant bepo_afnor
```
