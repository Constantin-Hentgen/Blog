Welcome to Forge-XDR-Agent, an open-source Python project that represents my personal journey in developing an Extended Detection and Response (XDR) system. This project serves as a pedagogical tool, allowing me to explore and apply key concepts in cybersecurity engineering while building a functional XDR solution from scratch.
