## Context

Web development is the spark that ignited my passion for computer science. My journey began with simple HTML and CSS, but it quickly evolved into a deeper interest in creating more sophisticated web applications. Building my own website was a natural progressionâ€”a way to apply and showcase what I have learned over the years.

This website serves as a clean and professional representation of who I am. It highlights my background, skills, and key projects, providing a comprehensive view of my work and expertise.

## Technologies Used

To create a modern and functional portfolio website, I utilized several advanced technologies:

- **Vue.js**: A progressive JavaScript framework that facilitates the development of interactive user interfaces. Vue.js enables the creation of dynamic components and ensures a responsive and engaging experience for users.

- **i18n**: An internationalization (i18n) plugin for Vue.js that allows the website to support multiple languages. This feature makes the portfolio accessible to a global audience and reflects my commitment to inclusivity.

- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework used to design and style the website. TailwindCSS provides a flexible and customizable approach to building responsive layouts and modern aesthetics.

- **Marked**: A markdown parser that converts markdown files into HTML. This tool helps manage and display content efficiently, ensuring that textual information is well-structured and readable.

- **Font Awesome**: A popular library of vector icons and social logos. Font Awesome enhances the visual appeal of the website by providing scalable icons that are easy to integrate and customize.
