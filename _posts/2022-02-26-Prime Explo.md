# Prime Numbers Database and Testing

## Objective

The goal of this project is to build a database of prime numbers and notable primes, as well as to provide functions for testing prime numbers. This resource aims to be a useful tool for mathematical applications and number theory research.

## Context

This project was initiated as a Python-based exercise during my Erasmus program in Denmark. It serves as a practical application of mathematical concepts and programming skills, combining computational techniques with mathematical theory.

## Technologies Used

The development of this project involved several technologies and libraries:

- **Python3**: The primary programming language used for implementing the project. Python is well-suited for scientific computing and data manipulation.

  - _Source:_ [Python Official Website](https://www.python.org/)

  - **MathPlotLib**: A plotting library for Python used to create visual representations of mathematical data and functions.

    - _Source:_ [Matplotlib Documentation](https://matplotlib.org/stable/contents.html)

  - **Numpy**: A fundamental package for numerical computing in Python, providing support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with mathematical functions.

    - _Source:_ [NumPy Documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/)

  - **Multiprocessing**: A Python module that allows for parallel processing, enhancing the performance of computational tasks by utilizing multiple CPU cores.

    - _Source:_ [Python Multiprocessing Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html)

  - **Pathos**: A library that extends Pythonâ€™s multiprocessing capabilities with additional features and tools for parallel computing.
    - _Source:_ [Pathos Documentation](https://pathos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

- **LaTeX**: A typesetting system used for formatting mathematical expressions and documents. LaTeX helps present complex mathematical notation clearly and professionally.

  - _Source:_ [LaTeX Project](https://www.latex-project.org/)

- **MySQL**: A relational database management system used to store and manage the prime numbers database. MySQL provides a robust and efficient way to handle large datasets.
