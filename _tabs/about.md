### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a young engineer working in France with a keen interest in **cybersecurity** and **Python programming**. My journey into the world of IT has been both exciting and enlightening, and I'm always eager to explore new technologies and innovations.

> Outside of my tech adventures, I'm a sports enthusiast who enjoys calisthenics and wandering in nature. Whether I'm diving into the latest cybersecurity trends, coding up a new Python project, hitting the gym, or off-road biking, I believe in embracing every opportunity to learn and grow.
